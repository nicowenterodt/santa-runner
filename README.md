### 🎅 WELCOME TO THE SANTA RUNNER!

🎄 When the world goes offline, you know what to do,
But this time it’s Santa, with a challenge for you!
Through forests of snow and trees standing tall,
Leap over the obstacles, don’t let him fall!

🎁 Each jump keeps the magic of Christmas alive,
How far can you go? How long can you thrive?
With snowmen to dodge and icy paths to outsmart,
It’s a holiday race—so let’s make a start!

🎅 [Tap to begin](https://nicowenterodt.github.io/santa-runner/), and let the joy run free,
Santa is counting on you—you’ll see!
