### 🎅 WELCOME TO THE SANTA RUNNER!

🎄 When the world goes offline, you know what to do,
But this time it’s Santa, with a challenge for you!
Through forests of snow and trees standing tall,
Leap over the snowman, don’t let him fall!

🎁 Each jump keeps the magic of Christmas alive,
How far can you go - How long can you thrive?
With snowmen to dodge and reindeers neer,
It’s a holiday race—so let’s give a cheer!

🎅 [Tap to start](https://www.santa-runner.com/) and spread the cheer,
Santa’s journey is finally here!
Leap and dodge, the goal is clear,
Keep him running—Christmas is near! 🎅✨"
